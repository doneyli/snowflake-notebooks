These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of operations may be adversely affected if these assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in the assumptions, which could cause the results of operations to fall below publicly announced guidance or the expectations of securities analysts and investors, potentially leading to a decline in the market price of the company's stock.\""
